The New Hacker^WMaker Desk Reference is intended to be a web-based series of calculators and reference materials for use at the workbench, or garage.

While I would absolutely love to make it an "all encompassing" guide, I think that may be too far fetched. I'd like to keep it as usable as possible, and that means leaving out scads of "less critical" information (like oddball units of measurement, like a "barrel" of petroleum -- most people won't deal with that in their garage.)

For the time being, you can find a semi-working version at http://calc.coffeebot.net  I'll update it perodically, but it probably won't be the most current version available.
